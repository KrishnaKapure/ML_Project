Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Logistic Regression
This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, fare, and embarkation point.
It also includes data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in survival.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ TitanicDataset.csv            # Input dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ titanic_logistic.py           # Python script containing the model
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                     # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ *.png                         # Generated visualization images
ðŸ“Œ Features
Data Cleaning

Removes unnecessary columns (Passengerid, zero)

Fills missing Embarked values with the mode

Data Visualization (Saved as .png files)

Survival count (overall, by gender, by passenger class)

Age distribution

Fare distribution

Feature correlation heatmap

Machine Learning Model

Uses Logistic Regression

Data scaled using StandardScaler

Model evaluated with accuracy score and confusion matrix

ðŸ›  Requirements
Install the required Python libraries before running the script:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
ðŸš€ How to Run
Place the dataset (TitanicDataset.csv) in the project directory.

Run the script:

python titanicSurvival.py
The program will:

Display the datasetâ€™s shape and head

Generate and save EDA plots as .png files

Train and test the Logistic Regression model

Print accuracy and confusion matrix in the console
